# What's a chalky?

Chalkies are anyone on the [sfchalkboard](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/sfchalkboard) mailing list.

# What's the list for?

[SF Chalkboard](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/sfchalkboard) is a mailing list for cooperative living in the San Francisco bay area. It's meant to strengthen ties between cooperative houses, collectives, activists and other intentional communities. To know what's going on in our wider world. It's the chalkboard in our collective kitchen.

# How do I join?

Go to [our info page](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/sfchalkboard), click subscribe

[This page](https://lists.riseup.net/www/help/introduction) explains how mailing lists work

# Do I need to live in a co-op?

Nope! The list is for anybody interested in living in an inclusive and supportive community that values cooperation, mutual aid, fun, and meaningful change. Anyone can join and post, whether they live in a co-op or not.

# Who runs it?

The moderators are: [yar](https://yar.gay/), etc

The server host is [riseup](https://riseup.net/). Their computers send and receive mail using an old version of [sympa](https://sympa-community.github.io/).

# How to post

Email your post to [sfchalkboard@lists.riseup.net](mailto:sfchalkboard@lists.riseup.net)
* **Double check** the address! A common mistake is to send to "sfchalkboard-request", which won't go to the list.
* Write a **descriptive subject** - let us know what your post will be about. For example, "Looking for a room in Oakland with queer friendly vegan punks"
* Write a **full email body** including all relevant content. Posts without much more than a link will be rejected!
* **Address the Chalkies group** in your message body - this discourages cross-posting and keeps content unique and personalized
* **No large attachments**
* **Room openings** must include full cost of the room (rent, utilities, and any other mandatory costs) in the subject line - see [below](#rooms)

When replying to posts:
* If you reply to a message using digest mode, please try to edit the quote text and subject
* If you want to reply to the author of a message, please remove the list address first.
* If the reply content is relevant to the entire list, please address the person + the entire list which supports coziness and keeps it from appearing like a conversation between two people. For example:
    > Becca & Chalkies. Becca, I wanted to respond to your post and yes all collectives, co-ops and community minded individuals are welcome to attend the gathering,...here’s the rest of the details...
* Riseup has a bug which fails to display the author's email address in some cases - digest users will not be able to see it, and the web archives will not show it either. We have reported this bug to riseup, but they will probably take a very long time to fix it. Sorry! If you're a digest user and you want to send a private reply, send it to [sfchalkboard-editors](mailto:sfchalkboard-editors@lists.riseup.net) and the moderators will put you in touch.

# What to post

* Room openings
* Community events
* Parties, potlucks
* Discussion groups
* Resources, skillshares

Examples of a good post:
> Chalkboard community - there’s this protest in SF downtown tomorrow. We’d love your support, here are all of the logistics and details.

# Monie$

The list accepts posts regarding goods, workshops & events that cost money, as long as money alternatives are offered, ie: work trade, no one turned away for lack of funds, suggested donation, trade/barter. For example:
> Hi Chalkies, our co-op is offering a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ workshop, its a 15.00 suggested donation for materials but no one will be turned away for lack of funds, here are all of the logistics and details

> Hi Chalk board friends, I’d like to trade my car for a bicycle, i’m also willing to consider hours trades from folks on timebank.sfbace.org or earn.timebanks.org…
Posts that are clearly for profit or promoting a for-profit activity (of either a business or individual) AND/OR do not offer any of the above payment options will be declined.

# Rooms

> Hi SFChalkboard, There's a room available in our co-op starting May 15th…

> Hello Lovely Chalkies, I’m wanting to start a new co-op housing in San Francisco with a group of mindful people…, contact me directly and let’s see how we can make use of our resources to co-create...

SFChalkboard is for intentional, cooperative, community-style housing and co-operatives. Housing posts can include anything from a shared one bedroom to a million people collective, as long as there is an intention of fostering relationships and some form of communal living. SFChalkboard is committed to radical inclusivity and posts that are discriminatory will be rejected from the list

The kinds of posts that would not meet these criteria:
* Looking for somewhere to live, with no interest in exploring and supporting some form of intentional community
* Offering a room in a residence that is not community-oriented
* no colorblind housing posts (housing posts must state the races of current housemates, either individually or collectively, with an exception for ambiguously racialized folks who may explicitly opt out).
* no age requirements in housing, explicit or implicit - any post which states the ages of current housemates must note that applicants of all ages are welcome (which of course has to be true!).

For room rentals, please include the full cost of the room (rent, utilities, and any other mandatory costs) in the subject line. If you're posting multiple rooms, you can include a range, like: "3 Rooms in Amazing House $3-500 + $50 utilities"

Please include all the above required information in the email that goes out to the list itself, rather than directing people to an external post, like a Craigslist posting. List members should be able to satisfy the most pertinent questions that the above requirements seek to answer without having to follow a link.

# Jobs

When posting a job opportunity, please include the pay or pay range in the subject line. SFChalkboard's minimum wage is $20/hr or equivalent.

We do accept postings for work trade, internships, and other positions which don't involve a conventional paycheck, but workers must still be compensated fairly in some way - college credit, workshop participation, stock options, use your imagination. Exceptions are often made for jobs where you, the poster, don't control compensation, such as IHSS aide positions.

# SKILLZ & STUFF

Skill sharing is awesome, but self-promotional posts will be declined, unless you are offering your skill for trade/barter. Posts seeking someone with a specific skill set for a community project or personal project are welcome.

Giving away stuff is cool.

Requesting specific stuff is cool for for a community project, but not for a personal project (please make the difference clear for the mods who are reviewing your message).

These would ***NOT*** be ok:
> I’m a photographer specializing in nudes and am expanding my services to include pets. I offer very low rates for chalksters. Please call me to arrange an appointment. {:.dont}

> I’m unemployed, attached is my resume, I’m willing to work for minimum wage. {:.dont}

> I need some canning supplies. Anyone have any they want to give away? {:.dont}

These would be OK:
> Food Not Bombs needs some canning supplies.

> Does anyone know of a local resource for low-cost or free canning supplies?

EXCEPTION: Since there are many list members with businesses, and other list members who may want to support these businesses, each business is allowed ONE commercial post, ever. It can't sound like an ad. This is an experimental policy and if the Chalk starts to sound like Indie Craigslist, it will be rethought.
