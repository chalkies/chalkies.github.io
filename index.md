# What's a chalky?

Chalkies are anyone on the [sfchalkboard](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/sfchalkboard) mailing list.

# What's the list for?

[SF Chalkboard](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/sfchalkboard) is a mailing list for cooperative living in the San Francisco bay area. It's meant to strengthen ties between cooperative houses, collectives, activists and other intentional communities. To know what's going on in our wider world. It's the chalkboard in our collective kitchen.

# How do I join?

Go to [our info page](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/sfchalkboard), click subscribe

[This page](https://lists.riseup.net/www/help/introduction) explains how mailing lists work

# Do I need to live in a co-op?

Nope! The list is for anybody interested in living in an inclusive and supportive community that values cooperation, mutual aid, fun, and meaningful change. Anyone can join and post, whether they live in a co-op or not.

# Who runs it?

The moderators are:
* [Yardena Cohen](https://yar.gay/) aka "yar" [<yardenack@gmail.com>](mailto:yardenack@gmail.com)
* others who have not yet consented to be named here

The server host is [riseup](https://riseup.net/). Their computers send and receive mail using an old version of [sympa](https://sympa-community.github.io/).

# How to post?

Email your post to [sfchalkboard@lists.riseup.net](mailto:sfchalkboard@lists.riseup.net)
* **Double check** the address! A common mistake is to send to "sfchalkboard-request", which won't go to the list.
* Write a **descriptive subject** - let us know what your post will be about. For example, "Looking for a room in Oakland with queer friendly vegan punks"
* Write a **full email body** including all relevant content. Posts without much more than a link will be rejected!
* **Address the Chalkies group** in your message body - this discourages cross-posting and keeps content unique and personalized
* **No large attachments**
* We have special rules for posts about [housing](#rooms), anything involving [money](#money)

# How to reply?

When replying to posts:
* If you reply to a message using digest mode, please try to edit the quote text and subject
* If you want to reply to the author of a message, please remove the list address first.
* If the reply content is relevant to the entire list, please address the person + the entire list which supports coziness and keeps it from appearing like a conversation between two people. For example:
    > Becca & Chalkies. Becca, I wanted to respond to your post and yes all collectives, co-ops and community minded individuals are welcome to attend the gathering,...here’s the rest of the details...
    {:.do}
* Riseup has a bug which fails to display the author's email address in some cases - digest users will not be able to see it, and the web archives will not show it either. We have reported this bug to riseup, but they will probably take a very long time to fix it. Sorry! If you're a digest user and you want to send a private reply, send it to [sfchalkboard-editors](mailto:sfchalkboard-editors@lists.riseup.net) and the moderators will put you in touch.

# Will people know who I am?

Yes! It's an email list. Your name and email will be at the top.

If you'd like to post anonymously, [contact a mod](#who-runs-it) and one of us can send it for you. Or you can just say at the top of your email that you want to be anonymous. Then a mod can copy the text of your message and then reject the original.

# Can I delete a post?

No, sorry. We can delete it from the archives, but once everybody has received the email, we cannot delete it from their inboxes.

# What to post

* [Room openings](#rooms)
* Community events
* Parties, potlucks
* Discussion groups
* Resources, skillshares

Examples of a good post:
> Chalkboard community - there’s this protest in SF downtown tomorrow. We’d love your support, here are all of the logistics and details.
{:.do}

# What not to post

* anything racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ageist, etc
* anything promoting destructive technologies like bitcoin

# Money

The list accepts posts regarding goods, workshops & events that cost money, as long as money alternatives are offered, ie: work trade, no one turned away for lack of funds, suggested donation, trade/barter. For example:
> Hi Chalkies, our co-op is offering a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ workshop, its a 15.00 suggested donation for materials but no one will be turned away for lack of funds, here are all of the logistics and details
{:.do}
> Hi Chalk board friends, I’d like to trade my car for a bicycle, i’m also willing to consider hours trades from folks on timebank.sfbace.org or earn.timebanks.org…
{:.do}
Posts that are clearly for profit or promoting a for-profit activity (of either a business or individual) AND/OR do not offer any of the above payment options will be declined.

# Rooms

If you're a house looking for people:
* the **subject line must include the full cost** of the room (rent, utilities, and any other mandatory costs), or a range for multiple rooms, like "$3-500 + $50 utilities"
* you must **tell us if your house is mostly white** or all white, so BIPOC applicants have the option of avoiding these houses
* you must **not have age requirements**, and if you list your own ages you must **say you're open to all ages** (and mean it)
* the house must be communal, community-oriented, intentional or cooperative in some way, ie you want the person and not just their money
* you should tell us the move-in dates (and move-out, if subletting)
* you should include all this info in your actual email, not just link to an external/craigslist post

# Jobs

if you're posting a job opportunity:
* the **subject must include pay or pay range**
* the job must pay **at least $20/hr** or equivalent

We do accept postings for work trade, internships, and other positions which don't involve a conventional paycheck, but workers must still be compensated fairly in some way - college credit, workshop participation, stock options, use your imagination. Exceptions are often made for jobs where you, the poster, don't control compensation, such as IHSS aide positions.

# SKILLZ & STUFF

Skill sharing is awesome, but self-promotional posts will be declined, unless you are offering your skill for trade/barter. Posts seeking someone with a specific skill set for a community project or personal project are welcome.

Giving away stuff is cool.

Requesting specific stuff is cool for for a community project, but not for a personal project (please make the difference clear for the mods who are reviewing your message).

These would ***NOT*** be ok:
> I’m a photographer specializing in nudes and am expanding my services to include pets. I offer very low rates for chalksters. Please call me to arrange an appointment.
{:.dont}

> I’m unemployed, attached is my resume, I’m willing to work for minimum wage.
{:.dont}

> I need some canning supplies. Anyone have any they want to give away?
{:.dont}

These would be OK:
> Food Not Bombs needs some canning supplies.
{:.do}
> Does anyone know of a local resource for low-cost or free canning supplies?
{:.do}
EXCEPTION: Since there are many list members with businesses, and other list members who may want to support these businesses, each business is allowed ONE commercial post, ever. It can't sound like an ad. This is an experimental policy and if the Chalk starts to sound like Indie Craigslist, it will be rethought.

# I don't see my own post - did it go through?

Probably, unless you got a rejection notice. When in doubt, check the list archive. Some programs (like gmail) will not display the received version of a mail you sent, because they mark it as a duplicate.
